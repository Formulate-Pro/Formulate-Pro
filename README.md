# Formulate Pro Overview

Formulate Pro is a paid extension to Umbraco Formulate. You cannot use this software for free, and you cannot view the source code until you've paid for a license.

Umbraco Formulate is a form builder for Umbraco. More info here: [www.formulate.rocks](http://www.formulate.rocks/)

# Features

This list will grow over time, but these are the current capabilities of Formulate Pro:

* **Send Designed Emails** When a form is submitted, this will allow you to send emails based on Razor view files (i.e., CSHTML files). This will allow you to create fully custom email designs.

# Benefits

By paying for Formulate Pro, you not only get extra features that Formulate doesn't natively support, you also help fund additional development of Formulate in the future.

The more people pay for Formulate Pro, the more everyone benefits.

If you use Formulate, but you don't need Formulate Pro, I encourage you to pay for Formulate Pro as a show of support. While this is not necessary, I would greatly appreciate it.

Another benefit is that licenses are forever. If you pay for a license now when Formulate Pro is cheap, you will get all the future features of Formulate Pro for no additional cost.
